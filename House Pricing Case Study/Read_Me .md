## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following columns:

  - house_grade: The overall quality grade of the house.
  - #schools_nearby: The number of schools available near the property.
  - built_year: The year the house was built.
  - age_of_house: The calculated age of the house.
  - house_area_excl_basement: Total area of the house excluding the basement (in square feet).
  - basement_area: The size of the basement area (in square feet).

## Key Questions Analyzed
### Regional and External Influences:

- Does the proximity to schools or an airport influence house prices?
- Are there external economic factors (e.g., inflation rate) that affect house prices?
#### Property Features:

- Do houses with larger areas or basements cost more?
- Does the age of the house have a noticeable effect on the price?
#### Renovation Impact:

- How does the living area post-renovation influence the house price?

## Insights
