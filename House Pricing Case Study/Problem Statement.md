# Problem Statement
In the realm of financial services, understanding and assessing customer credibility is critical for mitigating risks and making informed decisions when extending credit facilities. This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing customer information and credit card payment details from April 2005 to September 2005. The dataset includes variables such as credit limits, repayment statuses, bill amounts, and payment history, as well as demographic attributes like gender, education, marital status, and age.

The primary objective is to identify patterns and factors that differentiate credible customers from non-credible ones. By examining the interplay between demographic attributes and financial behaviors, the goal is to derive actionable insights that can enhance financial institutions' risk assessment models and decision-making processes.

## This study aims to answer the following key questions:

- What demographic and financial behavior patterns are indicative of customer credibility?

- How do repayment statuses and bill payment histories correlate with the likelihood of default?

- What role do demographic attributes such as gender, education, marital status, and age play in influencing credit reliability?

- How can financial institutions leverage these insights to improve their risk assessment and credit decision strategies?

### Through detailed analysis and modeling, this project seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to customer credibility, ultimately supporting financial institutions in making more accurate and informed credit decisions.
